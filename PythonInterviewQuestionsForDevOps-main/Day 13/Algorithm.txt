Steps :-

#1: Declare & initialize the Array
#2: Find the Length of the Array
#3: Use 2 loops to find the duplicate elements. 
    The outer loop will iterate through the array from 0 to its length.
    The outer loop will select an element. 
    The inner loop will be used to compare the selected element with all the remaining elements of the array.
#4: If a match/duplicate element is found, display the element.
    Repeat until all of the duplicate elements are found.
